## Assignment
Assignment 1: Classes, Encapsulation and Unit Test Planning

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation was achieved by:
- Using private attributes (e.g., `_client_number`, `_balance`) to restrict direct access.
- Providing controlled access via `@property` methods.
- Adding validation in methods to ensure data integrity.
